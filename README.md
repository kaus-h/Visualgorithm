- **Graph Traversal Algorithms**: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm
- **Step-by-Step Animation Engine**: Real-time visualization with color-coded states (comparing, swapping, visited, exploring, path highlighting)
- **Interactive Playback Controls**: Play/pause, step-by-step navigation, variable speed control (1-100 range), and reset functionality


### Custom Graph Generation System

- **Dynamic Graph Builder**: Users can create custom graphs with configurable parameters (node count, graph type, edge density)
- **Multiple Graph Types**: Linear paths, circular graphs, grid layouts, star configurations, and random networks
- **Weighted Edge Support**: Optional edge weights for Dijkstra's algorithm with customizable weight ranges
- **Preset Configurations**: Quick-access templates for common graph structures
- **Modal-Based Interface**: Clean popup system for graph configuration with intuitive controls


### Advanced User Interface & Experience

- **Dark Theme Design**: Modern aesthetic with vibrant purple gradients and green/pink accent colors
- **High-Contrast Typography**: Custom gradient text effects using Space Grotesk and DM Sans fonts
- **Responsive Layout**: Mobile-first design with CSS Grid and Flexbox for optimal viewing across devices
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Click-to-select nodes for start/target points, hover effects, and smooth CSS transitions
- **Real-Time Statistics**: Algorithm complexity display, step counters, and performance metrics
